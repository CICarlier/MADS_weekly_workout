    "# Wipeout\n",
    "On November 1st 2019 I went out for a bike ride and wiped out. Not a little loss of control or a little skid, we're talking flying off the bike in traffic kind of wipe out. I finished my ride as I had planned, and when I was telling my wife about the incident she asked me where but I couldn't really remember. I did remember a few things though - can you help me track down where I wiped out from my ride log data, which I put in `wipeout.csv`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically I remember that:\n",
    "1. I launched off the bike. So at some point both my reported speed `enhanced_speed` and my reported  `cadence` from my wearables would have been 0.\n",
    "2. I was at least 5 minutes into my ride at the time, headed out of the city.\n",
    "4. I do remember stopping during my ride *before* I wiped out to give an in promptu lecture to a motorist on Miller as to whether cars belonged in the bike lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where and when did I wipe out (in units of `timestamp`, `position_lat_degrees` and `position_long_degrees`)."
